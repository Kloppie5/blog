    Editors being slow with representing folder structures. Python code runners that use different versions of python and therefore have import issues. Programming being more about dealing with setting up the programming environment than it is about actual programming. Code dependent on a billion different conventions created by different companies, all with terrible documentation. Coding is more about fighting the parser than it is about actually expressing your intent. Making any UI is a nightmare. Objects in memory depend on the runtime.
